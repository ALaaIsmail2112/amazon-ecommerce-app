## 🚀 Project Overview

This fullstack application provides two distinct views to serve different types of users:

- **Customer View:**  
  User-friendly interface for browsing products, managing shopping cart, and placing orders with ease.  
  Includes features like product search, filters, and user profile management for a smooth shopping experience.

- **Admin / Designer View:**  
  Dedicated dashboard for admins and designers to efficiently manage product listings, update inventory, handle orders, and manage users.  
  Features include product CRUD operations, order tracking, and user role management with enhanced controls.

Both views are tightly integrated with the backend API built with Node.js and Express to ensure secure authentication, real-time cart updates, and order processing.
